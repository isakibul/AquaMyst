## Getting Started
Start your journey with an impressive story about the world under the ocean, where sunlight never reaches. Where life survives differently using chemosynthesis instead of photosynthesis. The creatures of the world rely on chemicals from the ocean floor—like hydrogen sulfide and methane—from hydrothermal vents. Where there is no green plants because of no sunlight but there are special creatures—some even glow in the dark, using bioluminescence to communicate and attract food.

# Game Levels 🌊🧩

## Lights Of The Deep ✨
In this beginning level, you will navigate the dark ocean depths and uncovered the secrets of bioluminescent life. By this, you will ready to dive deeper to explore the heart of the ocean.

## The Source Of Life 🌋
Here you will unlock the secrets of the chemosynthesis and how life begins at these hydrothermal vents knowing instead of sunlight, how the creatures use the chemicals from these vents to survive. You will know how a small bacteria turns energy into life.

## The Creatures Of The Deep 🐙
In this level, you will discover the incredible creatures of the deep and learn how they survive in extreme environments. You will know the creatures that call this world home.

## The Balance Of Life ⚖️
In this level, you will uncover the delicate balance that keeps this mysterious ecosystem alive. Here you will explore the food web of the deep ocean.

## Create Your Oceanic Heaven 🏝️
In this final level, you'll design an oceanic haven, customize habitats, and ensure your ecosystem stays balanced. Here you will dive into your imagination and build something amazing! Here you will explore ocean world with Europa Clipper.


# Educational Goals 🎓🌍
1. Foster a deep understanding of bioluminescence and the unique adaptations of deep-sea creatures.
2. Empower students to comprehend chemosynthesis as an alternative to photosynthesis.
3. Enhance critical thinking skills by allowing students to study the survival strategies of deep-sea creatures.
4. Promote awareness of the interconnectedness of ecosystems by exploring the deep-sea food web.
5. Inspire creativity and systems thinking as students design their own balanced oceanic habitats.

# Play Now 🎮🚀✨
AquaMyst aims to engage students in understanding alternative ecosystems powered by chemosynthesis, while promoting creativity, critical thinking, and environmental awareness. By immersing them in the wonders of the deep ocean, it fosters curiosity and a sense of responsibility for the Earth’s diverse habitats.
